This is testing the behaviour of the goto-inspect binary in case a binary
is present, but no inspection option is present.

This is labelled `winbug` to avoid running on windows because of issues with
the empty string in line 3 (simulating the lack of an option) not working as
it should (it is contrary to the behaviour of unix systems). The behaviour
has been verified manually on a machine as working as expected, but getting
the test to run automatically is a lot more involved, so we're opting to
skipping this on that platform for now.
