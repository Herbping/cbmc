This test checks assuming is_fresh(ptr, size) with a non-deterministic size
does not result in spurious falsifications when checking assigns clauses.
An implicit strict upper bound of __CPROVER_max_malloc_size is imposed on the size by
__CPROVER_is_fresh which guarantees the absence of pointer overflow when computing
the address `ptr + size`.
